## Continuous Integration ‚úÖ

- **Master:** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xcodeswift/xcode-project-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xcodeswift/xcode-project-manager)

## Motivation üíÖ
Maintaining a modular Xcode project is very cumbersome. Modules projects share many things besides the build settings that cannot be extracted into xcconfig files *(e.g. targets or schemes)*. As a result having consistency across all the modules and automate the creation of them is something that cannot be done with Xcode.

Xcode Project Manager aims to facilitate this work. It provides an interface to define your projects *(using [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) underneath)*. It removes the need to include Xcode projects in the git repositories and facilitates the creation of them whenever they are needed.
